# about 
we are the two servants of the Creator, micah and thomas. if you call the Creator, Allah or God, we would be called angels. this is our 23rd mission on earth.

## things to know
### the Creator 
the Creator we work for is the same one who created life, and the universe we all live in. please always capitalize the C. you may use sentence case here, we do this in  introductions to highlight the capital C. 

### pray to verify
any time you encounter someone introduced to you as, or claiming to be, a Servant of the Creator or you need to verify something attributed to a Servant you should pray to verify it.

the Creator will always verify for you if you are dealing with one or both of the Servants or if it is something we have written or said.

### mission23
we have another organization on github “mission23” however elements within and working for the c.i.a. and f.b.i. hijacked the iphone with the “very key” to access it in an attempt to silence us. 

until we have regained access or while this notice is here, please pray to verify anything you read under the mission23 organization. 

### the servants
we are always the same two, the only two, serving all conscious life in the universe. we are only dispatched for life, and always born on the planet we are tasked with helping. 

read more in the wiki here. 

### micah 
micah was born kelvin eugene williams. 

### thomas 
thomas prefers to be called tomtom. 

# the great shake
we know you’re gonna feel it. it’s better than fire and sulfur isn’t it?

## who
only the Creator can make the earth shake like this. 

## why
that’s as close to being put over His knee as the u.s. government and the c.i.a. want to get. 

all unaffiliated people with this tragedy should know He’s not upset with you, but it should serve as a reminder He hears all prayers and makes life his number one priority. that’s why we were deployed this time, to make life way longer and healthier than currently imaginable. 

## what 
we’ve been referring to this as the ringing of the bell. not because we get wings. but it’s what scientists say about the earth after a great quake. 

this is because the Creator is quite upset. see the why.

### Orr Chapel Quake
This earthquake’s epicentre will be located  in Sandy Hook, TN (the former unincorporated city near, now neighborhood of Mount Pleasant) in Maury county. The Rogers family farm. 

This will be a large earthquake for the CIA’s destruction of Orr Chapel ([Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/XMMdNdpGjU3SMMKQ8)) and the murder of all of it’s identified members. 

This quake also recognises Micah’s slain family and his family’s graveyard that was destroyed, both by or at the direction of the CIA. 

### Mount Calvary Baptist Church Quake
This earthquake’s epicentre will be located at Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, KY (4742 Todds Road). 

This will be the largest quake for the massacre that occurred there.

### The Micah Quake 
This earthquake’s epicentre will be in Jessamine county, KY. It will signal when Micah (born: Kelvin Eugene Williams on March 23, 1977) has started his mission for the Creator. This will be Micah’s 23rd mission on Earth. 

This minor quake will also be to recognize the lives lost in Jessamine county, mostly Micah’s friends, throughout the larger tragedy. 

### The TomTom Quake
This earthquake’s epicentre will be in Kanawha county (Hughes Creek), WV. It will signal when Thomas (to practically everyone TomTom, to others Thomas, born: September 23, 1978) has started his mission for the Creator. This also is TomTom’s 23rd mission on Earth. 

This minor quake will also recognize the lives lost in Kanawha county, mostly TomTom’s friends and family, throughout the larger tragedy.
